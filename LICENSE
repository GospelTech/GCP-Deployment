13.1	No party granted rights under this Agreement may sub-license or assign, sub-contract or delegate any or all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other.
13.2	Certain extensions and other materials or services made available for download or access via the Platform may be developed and/or provided by third parties (“Third-Party Content”). Gospel makes such Third-Party Content available for download on as a convenience to its customers, but Gospel neither controls nor endorses, nor is Gospel responsible for, any Third-Party Content, including the accuracy, integrity, quality, legality, usefulness or safety of Third-Party Content. Certain Third-Party Content may, among other things, be inaccurate, non-functional, infringing or dangerous. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by Gospel with respect to any Third-Party Content. Gospel has no obligation to monitor Third-Party Content, and Gospel may block or disable access to any Third-Party Content at any time. In addition, the availability of any Third-Party Content does not imply Gospel's endorsement of, or affiliation with, any provider of such Third-Party Content, nor does such availability create any legal relationship between the Customer and any such provider. The Customer’s use of Third-Party Content is at the Customer’s own risk and may be subject to any additional terms, conditions and policies applicable to such Third-Party Content (such as licence terms, terms of service or privacy policies of the providers of such Third-Party Content).
13.3	If the Customer acquired the Licensed Materials through an authorised reseller, partner or OEM of Gospel (“Authorised Partner”) then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (a) the Customer’s use of the Licensed Materials is subject to any additional terms in the agreement provided by the Authorised Partner; (b) Customer agrees to pay the Authorised Partner all applicable charges and fees, and the Customer will have no direct fee payment obligations to Gospel for such Licensed Materials; (c) the Customer’s agreement with the Authorised Partner is between the Customer and the Authorised Partner and is not binding on Gospel; and (d) Gospel may terminate this Agreement (including the Customer’s right to use the Licensed Materials) if Gospel does not receive payment for the Customer’s use of the Licensed Materials from the Authorised Partner or if the Customer breaches any term of this Agreement or if required for compliance with the terms of the agreement between Gospel and the Authorised Partner at any time. If the Customer’s warranty and support terms stated in its agreement with the Authorised Partner are different from those set forth in this Agreement, then such different terms are solely between the Customer and the Authorised Partner and Gospel will have no obligations to the Customer under this Agreement with respect to such different terms. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if there is any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and the Customer’s agreement with Authorised Partner, then this Agreement will control (and will resolve such inconsistency) as between Gospel and the Customer.
13.4	If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision(s) shall be construed, as much as possible, to reflect the intentions of the invalid or unenforceable provision(s), with all other provisions remaining in full force and effect. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between Customer and Gospel as a result of this Agreement or use of the Licensed Materials. The failure of either party to enforce any right or provision in this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by such party in writing. This Agreement, (including any other documents referenced therein), comprises the entire agreement between Customer and Gospel regarding the subject matter contained herein and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties regarding such subject matter. All notices from Customer to Gospel may be made by emailing legal@gospel.tech and Gospel may give notice by emailing Customer’s contact as specified in this Agreement. The Customer agrees that “Powered by Gospel” or similar marks may appear in forms, web pages and other outputs of the Licensed Materials.

13.5	Neither Party shall mention or otherwise use the name, insignia, symbol, trademark, trade name or logotype of the other Party or its Affiliates in any publication, press release, promotional material or other form of publicity without the prior written consent of the other Party. The restrictions imposed by this section will not prohibit either Party from making any disclosure identifying the other Party that is required by applicable law, rule or regulation, provided that any such disclosure shall be subject to the terms of confidentiality set out in this Agreement.
13.6	Both parties shall:
	(a)	comply with all applicable laws, statutes, regulations and codes relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, including the Bribery Act 2010 ("Act");
	(b)	not do anything which would constitute an offence or which would cause the Customer to commit an offence under the Act;
	(c)	have and shall maintain in place throughout the term of this Agreement its own policies and procedures (copies of which will be made available to the Customer upon request), including adequate procedures to ensure compliance with the Act as informed by the principles outlined in the guidance to the Act, and will enforce them where appropriate;

13.10	This Agreement is governed by English law. The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in relation to any dispute or difference between the parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, its interpretation or subject-matter but both parties are also entitled to apply to any court worldwide for injunctive or other remedies in order to protect or enforce its Intellectual Property Rights and/or Confidential Information.
